# About Us

**There’s a fundamental shift sweeping the accommodation industry. Guests today expect a superior guest experience. One that is seamless, personalised and immersive. But if hotels don’t deliver, you’ll lose ratings, rankings, and this will ultimately hurt your profits.**

We don’t want you to get left behind.

The Booking Factory is an all-in-one hotel management system designed with one goal in mind - to help you master the guest experience. We help you do this in three ways.

Firstly, you’ll get user-friendly software with practical tools to manage your business. You can build a website with ease and generate bookings consistently online.

Secondly, you’ll save hours of staff time by automating your day to day admin and tasks.

Lastly, you’ll leave the formalities of manual check-in behind so you can concentrate on being the perfect host. With our online check-in and smart kiosks in property, guests will be in their rooms in seconds.

## About the Founder

I’m Evan Davies, the founder of The Booking Factory.

I was born into the hotel industry. My parents ran a successful family hotel in Wales for over 40 years.

I launched The Booking Factory because we needed a simple tool to manage the business and increase direct bookings. With limited options on the market, I set out to create my own.

As we built the product and gained customers, we noticed a bigger trend emerge. The demand for an exceptional customer experience.

Customer experience has always been number one, but we haven’t always acknowledged the fact. Today’s guests expect a lot more from hotels than they used to. Before technology, it was enough to provide a clean bed and a decent breakfast.

Now guests demand smart check-in kiosks, mobile apps and smart room appliances. Some guests don’t want to talk to anyone, and some want you to act like a dinner party host.

Crucially, smart hotel technology helps us cope with these new demands. And we’re here to help you manage and integrate all the new and exciting changes to come.

If you’d like to chat about mastering your guest experience with hotel software, or a potential partnership, please drop me an email to evan@thebookingfactory.com

Regards, **Evan Davies**
